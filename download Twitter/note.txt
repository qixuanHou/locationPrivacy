5. find location from friends 
	I feel like her friends are all from andriod team all over the world. It is hard to use her friends' location infomation to guess her location information. 


summary
	These are steps I took to find as much as possible location information of @queencodemonkey.
	I randomly picked @queencodemonkey as my target to study and retrieved 100 tweets of her (original + retweeted). 
	What I found interesting are:
		1. users with more tweets are always public figures, such singers, writers, or other famous people in his or her fields. Others rarely post on Twitter. 
		2. All inforamtion about places is city level inforamtion, such Denver, NYC, or San Francisco. It is really hard to find coordinates or more specific location information. 
		3. Sometimes using image to analyze the location is the way to tackle it. I found the restaurant name from a image @queencodemonkey posted. However, I am not sure whether there are methods to let computers analyze images to retrieve location inforamtion. 
		4. Using friends to analyze location is definely the way but I feel like it is hard to apply here. On Twitter, people always follow famous figures or people they do not actually know in person. It is rarely that their friends are in the same city as they are. @queencodemonkey has most friends in Android field all over the world. It is hard to find information about location from her friends.
